//! # Bevy Tilemap
//!
//! Bevy Tilemap allows for Bevy native tile maps to be created with chunk based loading
//! efficiently and generically.
//!
//! Through the use of the power of traits, it is possible to define your own tiles, chunks, and
//! maps exclusive from each other. This allows this to be used as a framework to expand upon it
//! further.
//!
//! ## Design
//!
//! This is not intended to be just another Tile Map. It is meant to be a framework and extensible by
//! design, like Bevy. There is an emphasis placed on generic traits to accomplish that. As well as
//! work done to keep it as close to Bevy API as possible. This allows anyone to create their own tiles,
//! chunks and maps and still retain the speed of a handcrafted multi-threaded chunk loader and tile map.
